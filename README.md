## Skills / Concepts demonstrated
this is a fully-fledge powerbi project. The skill demonstrated is as follows:
- page navigation
- button
- filter
- dax
- bookmarking
- tooltips
- modelling
- quick measures

## Data collection
The relevant data is collected from the company internal database in which the tables involve are:
customers,orders,packages,company,companyusers,ridertag tables

## Data cleaning and data transformation
The data cleaning process was performed basically on package table referencing only the pickup city and delivery city 
and the cleaning was performed to some cities that are outside nigeria because of the company restriction to foreign shipments

## Data Measures
The key primary indicators is used to track the performance of the business overtime. this furthermore reveals the general strength and weakness
of the business. however the KPIs are calculated in data analysis expresssion (Dax) such as:
-Average order value
AOV = AVERAGE(FactLogisticsDatas[OrderPrice])
-Gross merchandise value
GMV = sum(FactLogisticsDatas[OrderPrice])
-Interstate AOV
InterAOV = CALCULATE([AOV],DimOrderMode[OrderMode ID] = 2)
-Intrastate AOV
IntraAOV = CALCULATE([AOV],DimOrderMode[OrderMode ID] = 1)
-Revenue 
Revenue = SUM(FactLogisticsDatas[CommissionPrice])
-TotalOrders
TotalOrder = COUNTROWS(FactLogisticsDatas)
-CompletedShipment 
Completed Shipment = CALCULATE([TotalOrder],FILTER(FactLogisticsDatas,FactLogisticsDatas[OrderStatus ID] = 1))
-Failed Delivery Rate(%)
FailedDeliver% = DIVIDE([FailedDeliver],[TotalDeliveries])
-Ontime Delivery Rate(%)
OntimeDelivery% = DIVIDE([OntimeDeliver],[TotalDeliveries]
-Failed Pickup Rate(%)
FailedPickup% = DIVIDE([FailedPickup],[TotalPickup])
-Ontime Pickup Rate(%)
OntimePickup% = DIVIDE([OntimePickup],[TotalPickup])

## Recommendations and conclusion
1. The company should focus more on customers that booked large volume of orders for customers retention rate
2. the company should focus on how they can improve on ontime effective delivery and ontime effective pickup
3. the company should focus on customers generating the most revenue
